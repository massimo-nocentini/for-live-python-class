# for-live-python-class
Edited from registering a class about best practices in Python for the University of Florence.

Our goal is to show basic interactions with Git to produce a working version of slides for 
the current lecture (given in the (early) morning of May 6, 2020).

The vanilla notebook can be read at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/massimo-nocentini/for-live-python-class/blob/master/best-practices.ipynb.
